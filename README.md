# Task Management Server With Mongoose.

### This is the Backend part of task management app with fully functional CRUD operation that i build with Node.js/Express.js and used MongoDB as database to store the User, Task and Comment data.

#

## To Test the Routes:

### This Server CRUD Operation can be tested on "http://localhost:3000".

#

## For Test User Routes: you can add "/api/user"

## For Test Task Routes: you can add "/api/task"

### For Seed Rout add: "api/task/seed"

### For Search Rout add: "api/task/search?query='your_search'"

## For Test Comment Routes: you can add "/api/comment"

#

# My Thoughts

### I Learned more from the Documentation and want keep reading them to solve the future challenges in better way.

### The most challenging part of this project was the Search route and adding good Schema for my future use.

### I would add more routes if had more time.
